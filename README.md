# vncresolver-cli

A simple script to fetch data from vncresolver.com and generate a simple
overview page with the info.

## Usage

Just run the script and answer the questions. You give it the 2 character
ISO country code for the country you want the vnc resolver info for.
Select if you want to get the output as HTML, XML or json.

If you select HTML, you get the option to download the screenshots so
you do not have to link to the original online (they are throttled so
you will likely get broken image links).

## Credits

All credit for the vncresolver goes to computernewb.com.

Also go check out their
[bot on mastodon](https://fedi.computernewb.com/@vncresolver) where it
posts a new random screenshot every hour.

This script is thrown togehter by Kim Schulz [schulz.dk](https://schulz.dk) for
fun and to identify how much critical infrastructure is actually
publicly accessible via VNC in different countries.
